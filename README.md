#ui-tooltip
This is a self resizing and positioning tooltip. To use it, just wrap it around
and element.

You can set content two ways `label="text"`, or with nested html like:

```html
<ui-tooltip>
  <span>wrapped element</span>
  <span tip>tooltip content</span>
  </ui-tooltip>
```

Tooltips are hover driven, so aren't all the great for mobiles.
